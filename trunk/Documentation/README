## Prequisites

* Comsol Multiphysics v.???

## Installation

To ensure the communication between Monofin and Comsol, first Comsol must be 
installed on the computer running Monofin. Second, the PATH environment 
variable must contain the following path: INSTALLATION_FOLDER_OF_COMSOL/bin.
Monofin will try to call a script (comsolapi on Linux/Max and comsolapi.bat
on Windows) to execute simulations, thus the script must be accessible system
widely.
